# 🧂 port – The Portfolio with Extra Spice

Welcome to **cool’s digital playground**! This isn’t just a portfolio—it's a pixel-packed parade of *I-did-it-myself* web wizardry. If you're here to peek at projects, get inspired, or shamelessly copy code... well, fine, just don’t forget the seasoning.

## 🍕 What’s Inside?

This repo serves up a sizzling slice of my web development work:
- `index.html` – The homepage that slaps (in a good way).
- `portfolio-details.html` – Where the cool stuff gets cooler.
- `/assets` – Images, styles, scripts… basically the vibes.
- `/forms/contact.php` – Because someone might actually message me (gasp!).
- GitHub workflows (yeah, I automate things too 😎).

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I wanted a corner of the internet that screams:  
> “I write code. I design things. I drink chai. Look at my stuff.”

Also, recruiters love links. So here’s mine.

## ✨ How to View It Like a Fancy Person

Or just clone it and open `index.html` because you’re the DIY type.
